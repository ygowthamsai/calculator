        <li> 500 Words Essay On Indian Army The East India Company formed a military department to protect
            its territories in 1776. Initially, it was
            composed of British officers commanding soldiers recruited locally in India. The Indian Army, as it is known
            today, came into existence on 26 January 1950. Here are a few points to note about the Indian Army.<br></li>
    </ul>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>Enrolment in the Indian Army is voluntary, and unlike other countries, it has never been imposed forcefully.
        </li>
        <li>

            Due to its large size, the Indian army is divided into various regiments like the Sikh regiment, the Maratha
            regiment, and the Gurkha regiment. This was done to manage and deploy the army easily in terms of conflict.
            Its
            motto is “Service Before Self”.</li>
        <li>There are six operational commands and one training command.

            Its headquarters are in New Delhi. Currently Smt. Draupadi Murmu is the Supreme Commander of the Indian
            Army,
            and General Manoj Pande is the current Chief of Army Staff.</li>
        <li> We celebrate Army day on January 15 every year.

            The Indian army also conducts peace-keeping operations for the United Nations and other countries abroad. We
            have the largest standing army in the world in terms of numerical superiority.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Drills And Operations
            The Indian Army conducts drills and operations throughout the year, and some of its operations are also
            conducted in partnership with other nations. The most prominent drill of the Indian Army was Operation
            Brasstacks, conducted from November 1986 to January 1987 near the Pakistan border.</li>

        <li>Indo- Pakistan War (1947) | The first major operation conducted by the Indian Army was the Indo- Pakistan
            war of
            1947 which erupted due to tensions between India and Pakistan over the accession of Jammu and Kashmir. Since
            then Indian Army has been instrumental in neutralising terror groups and maintaining peace with the country.
        </li>

        <li>India at the time of partition had more than 500 princely states, and of these princely states, Hyderabad
            and
            Jammu- Kashmir was reluctant to join India.</li>
        <li> The Maharaja of Jammu Kashmir finally acceded to the Union of
            India,
            and the Indian Army was called in for assistance against the Pakistani army intrusion in Jammu and Kashmir.

            Accession Of Hyderabad | The Nizam of Hyderabad wanted to remain independent and was against joining the
            Union
            of India.</li>
        <li>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel negotiated the accession of Hyderabad to India after an invasion by the
            Indian Army named Operation Polo.

            Other Significant Battles | The Kargil war, the Indo-Sino war of 1962, and the 1967 Sino-Indian conflict
            were
            some conflicts that established India as a dominant force in Southeast Asia, courtesy of the Indian Armed
            Forces.</li>

        <li>Operations On Foreign Soil There have been instances where the Indian Army has operated on foreign soil to
            maintain peace within
            neighbouring countries and nations. The 1971 Bangladesh war of liberation for the independence of east
            Pakistan
            from Pakistan was supported by the Indian Government. </li>
        <li>This war involved the Indian Army providing support to
            a
            Bengali freedom fighter group known as the Mukti Bahini, eventually leading to the liberation of Bangladesh.
            The
            Indian Army also supported the Maldives government during a coup against the incumbent government.</li>

        <li>Fight Against Terrorism The Indian Army has been capable of avoiding and responding to terror attacks. This
            was seen during the terror attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. The terrorists were neutralised with great
            efficiency, and hostages were
            rescued within a short period by the army. </li>
        <li>Surgical strikes were also conducted against terror camps by the
            army as part of its operations against terror groups and to achieve regional stability. Our soldiers fight
            at the
            borders so that citizens have a safe and stable life. The Indian army ensures the safety of India and its
            citizens through its operations and networking.</li>
